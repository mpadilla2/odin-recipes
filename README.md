# odin-recipes

## Description

This is my solution to "Recipes", the first project in the Full Stack Javascript path of the Open-Source curriculum called [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/).

## Purpose

The purpose of the project is to demonstrate my ability to put together a *basic*, four page HTML website (no CSS) from scratch, without use of a code editor and its associated extensions (ie. VSCode).

## Structure

The structure of the website is simple: The main page (index.html) links to three additional pages which display their own recipe.

## Skills Demonstrated
