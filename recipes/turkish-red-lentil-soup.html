    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This soup is divine and much like you will get at any authentic Turkish restaurant. It has dynamic flavors and a lovely mild heat. I make a big batch and eat it for lunch with crusty bread and salad the entire week. Optional: Serve with additional mint and lemon wedges.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
	<li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
	<li>½ onion, diced</li>
	<li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
	<li>¼ cup diced tomatoes, drained</li>
	<li>5 cups chicken stock</li>
	<li>½ cup red lentils</li>
	<li>¼ cup fine bulgur</li>
	<li>¼ cup rice</li>
	<li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
	<li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
	<li>½ teaspoon cayenne pepper (Optional)</li>
	<li>1 tablespoon dried mint</li>
	<li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat.</li>
        <li>Cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until it begins to soften, about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir the garlic into the onion and cook another 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the diced tomatoes to the onion mixture.</li>
        <li>Continue to cook and stir another 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour in the chicken stock, red lentils, bulgur, rice, tomato paste, paprika, cayenne pepper, and mint to the tomato mixture.</li>
        <li>Season with salt and black pepper.</li>
        <li>Bring the soup to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low.</li>
        <li>Cook at a simmer until the the lentils and rice are cooked through, about 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Pour the soup into a blender to no more than half full.</li>
        <li>Firmly hold the lid in place and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree.</li>
        <li>Puree in batches until smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour into your serving dish.</li>
        <li>You can instead use a stick blender and puree the soup in cooking pot.</li>
    </ol>
